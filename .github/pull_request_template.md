# Checklist ✅:
- [ ] 👀 No **secrets** in clear text in the pull request
- [ ] 🎫 Format the pull request title like `[ISSUE-XXXX] - Fixes bug in ApproximateQuantiles`, where you replace `ISSUE-XXXX` with the appropriate JIRA issue. 
      Best practice is to use the JIRA issue title in the pull request title and the first line of the commit message.
- [ ] 📚 To categorize release notes, the pull request should be labeled with at least one of the well-known labels:
  - feat: for feature improvements or new features (minor version update)
  - fix: bug fix (patch version update)
  - chore: for miscellaneous changes
  - docs: adding or updating documentation
  - style: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
  - refactor: code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
  - perf: A code change that improves performance
  - test: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
  - build: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (example scopes: gulp, broccoli, npm)
  - ci: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (example scopes: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs)
  - revert: reverting to the previous commit

**Note**: If your branch was created with any of those prefixes above, your PR would automatically be labeled.
  e.g., When your source branch in a PR is `**feat**/<branch-name>`, your PR will automatically have the `**feat**` label.
